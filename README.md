PyBer Analysis:

The main purpose of this analysis is to determine and gain an understanding of Pyber ride sharing. 
It is also meant to gain an understanding of the different fare metrics in which the different types of cities Pyber can conduct. 
However, when we compare these metrics, we can help by improving these methods and determine the cost of these fares within each city, and also determine affordability in underpriviledged neighborhoods.

Conclusion:

In conclusion to this, we discovered that Urban cities generate the greatest revenue for Pyber
    We can conclude that people in Urban cities pay much less when it comes to rides, and as because of that, each driver earns less per ride
Lastly, rural areas seem to have greater and more expensive fare rates as opposed to customers who live in the urban cities.

In summary, based on personal recommendations to Pyber would include:
    Increasing the number of drivers in rural areas to avoid high fares
    Avoiding or limiting long trips in rural areas, to meet the demand when it comes to driver availability, as it can highly affect during high peak hours of the business
